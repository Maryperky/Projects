      <p>More than 5 million businesses were started last year. But while many people have an entrepreneurial streak, coming up with business ideas can be challenging.Even more difficult is knowing which business ideas won't require a large initial investment. As someone who's been self-employed as an independent contractor for 12 years, I understand how important it can be to keep start-up costs low. Here are five affordable business ideas that almost anyone can start;</p>

      <p><span>1. Consulting:</span>
I once worked for two national associations doing public relations and online marketing. When I became a full-time writer, I thought I wouldn't use those skills anymore. I was wrong. I've been asked to work on projects on a freelance consulting basis for similar organizations, using my experience in a new way.

Many companies need experienced professionals who understand the nuances of their industry. If you have years of experience in a field, your skills in creating marketing plans, business management, or financial oversight could be in high demand. For example, Indeed says technology consultants -- who help companies decide what tech to use for their services -- are paid an average annual salary of $82,885.</p>

      <p> <span>2. Dropshipping: </span>
If you've ever bought a dayplanner from a specialty website or ordered a custom-made T-shirt for an event, you've probably interacted with a dropshipping company.

With dropshipping, you set up an e-commerce site with your own products, such as stickers, socks, artwork, etc., but outsource the printing and shipping to another company. Without the need to have lots of inventory on hand, you can start your dropshipping business with little cash.

To host an e-commerce site through Shopify, you'll spend about $29 per month, plus a fee when you make a sale.</p>

      <p> <span>3. Selling something on Etsy:</span> 
While there's a lot of competition on Etsy these days, it's still a very affordable place for people to sell their goods online. Etsy charges $0.20 per listed item on its site and takes a small cut for each item sold. Those start-up costs are low compared to launching a brick-and-mortar store with rent costs, utility expenses, insurance, and employee payroll.

Just be sure to temper your expectations for how much you'll earn. While some people successfully tap into niche markets on the platform, the average annual income of Etsy sellers is between $2,900 and $46,000. That's a huge range, which means you'll likely have to start slow before making this your sole source of income.</p>
